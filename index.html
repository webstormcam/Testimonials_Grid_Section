            <p class="white_text"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                more so, in the
                company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth. </p>
            <p class="grey"> "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most gruling
                - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've succesfully switched careers, working as a Software
                Engineer at a VR startup" </p>

            <p class="white_text"> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance
                from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p class="grey"> "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the presonal attention you need

            <p class="finalgrey">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                fromer
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                staff
                did not disappoint . They were very hand-on and I never had to wait long for asistance . The
                agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding . It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                my
                developent experience . It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend. "</p>
