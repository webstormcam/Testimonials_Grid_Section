            <p class="white_text"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                more so, in the
                company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth. </p>
            <p class="grey"> "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most gruling
                - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've succesfully switched careers, working as a Software
                Engineer at a VR startup" </p>
